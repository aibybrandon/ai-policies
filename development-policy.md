# AI Development and Engineering Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy sets forth the principles, procedures, and responsibilities for the development, engineering, testing, deployment, and maintenance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems within the organization. The goal is to ensure that AI technologies are developed in a manner that is responsible, ethical, transparent, secure, and aligned with corporate values and regulatory requirements.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners, and third-party service providers who are involved in the development, deployment, or oversight of AI systems within the organization. It encompasses all stages of the AI lifecycle, from data acquisition and model development to deployment and post-deployment monitoring.

## 3. Guiding Principles
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility must be assigned at every stage of AI development.
- **Transparency**: AI systems must be understandable and traceable in their development and behavior.
- **Fairness**: AI systems must be designed to minimize bias and promote inclusive, equitable outcomes.
- **Security and Privacy**: AI development must ensure data protection, model robustness, and compliance with privacy laws.
- **Human Oversight**: Systems must be developed with appropriate mechanisms for human intervention and control.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
- **AI Governance Committee**: Oversees compliance with AI-related policies, including ethical review and approval of high-risk AI projects.
- **AI Development Teams**: Responsible for following approved methodologies, documenting decisions, and conducting rigorous testing.
- **Data Scientists/Engineers**: Ensure model performance, fairness, and reproducibility; document datasets, model features, and evaluation metrics.
- **Security and Privacy Officers**: Ensure compliance with security and privacy standards in all AI applications.
- **Legal and Compliance**: Review and approve models for regulatory adherence and contractual obligations.

## 5. Development Standards
- **Documentation**: All models must be accompanied by detailed documentation covering:
  - Problem definition
  - Data sources and preprocessing
  - Model architecture and training process
  - Evaluation metrics and validation methods
  - Known limitations and assumptions

- **Version Control**: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) for source code, training data snapshots, and model artifacts.

- **Code Quality**: Follow standard software engineering practices, including code reviews, unit testing, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

- **Reproducibility**: Models must be reproducible using shared scripts and documented configurations.

## 6. Data Requirements
- **Data Governance**: Ensure data used for AI training is legally obtained, high-quality, relevant, and representative.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Conduct audits for dataset imbalance and test for model fairness across demographics.
- **Anonymization**: Personally identifiable information (PII) must be removed or anonymized unless explicitly authorized.

## 7. Testing and Validation
- **Pre-deployment Testing**: All AI models must pass:
  - Accuracy and performance benchmarks
  - Fairness and bias assessments
  - Stress testing and adversarial robustness checks

- **Explainability**: Where applicable, provide methods for model interpretability (e.g., SHAP, LIME, saliency maps).

- **Red Teaming**: Simulate attacks and misuse scenarios to identify vulnerabilities.

## 8. Deployment and Monitoring
- **Deployment Approval**: Require sign-off by the AI Governance Committee and Legal/Compliance before production release.
- **Post-deployment Monitoring**:
  - Track real-world performance and fairness metrics
  - Monitor for model drift and data anomalies
  - Maintain audit logs for model inputs, predictions, and decisions

- **Fallback Procedures**: Implement rollback and human fallback mechanisms in case of model failure or unexpected behavior.

## 9. Incident Response
- Define AI-specific incident types (e.g., discriminatory outputs, data breaches, model drift).
- Establish triage and escalation paths for reporting and resolving incidents.
- Conduct root-cause analysis and share findings with relevant stakeholders.

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- Schedule periodic reviews of all AI systems.
- Reassess data, models, and assumptions when there are changes in regulations, business requirements, or societal impacts.
- Encourage feedback and learning from users and domain experts.

## 11. Compliance and Enforcement
- Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment or contracts.
- Compliance audits will be conducted at least annually.
- All personnel involved in AI development must complete mandatory training.

## 13. Review Cycle
This policy shall be reviewed and updated annually or as necessary based on regulatory changes, technological advancements, or organizational needs.
