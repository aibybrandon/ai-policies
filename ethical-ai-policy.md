# Responsible AI and Ethical AI Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy outlines the ethical principles and governance framework that guide the design, development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems across the organization. It ensures our AI practices align with human rights, fairness, accountability, and transparency while fostering trust with users, customers, and the public.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all departments, teams, employees, contractors, and third-party vendors involved in the design, procurement, deployment, or use of AI technologies across the organization.

## 3. Guiding Ethical Principles

### 3.1 Fairness and Non-Discrimination
- AI systems must be free from bias and discrimination based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, age, disability, or other protected attributes.
- Equity audits and fairness assessments are required for all high-impact AI systems.

### 3.2 Transparency and Explainability
- Individuals should be informed when they are interacting with or being affected by an AI system.
- Where feasible, AI models should be explainable, and decisions interpretable, especially in high-stakes domains like hiring, healthcare, or finance.

### 3.3 Accountability
- Human oversight must be embedded in all AI systems.
- Clear roles and responsibilities must be assigned for managing and auditing AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

### 3.4 Privacy and Data Protection
- AI must be developed in compliance with applicable data protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA.
- Personal data must be minimized, anonymized where possible, and processed securely and lawfully.

### 3.5 Safety and Reliability
- AI systems must be tested for robustness and resilience to ensure they do not produce harmful or unintended outcomes.
- Fail-safes or fallback mechanisms must be in place for systems operating in critical environments.

### 3.6 Human-Centric Design
- AI must enhance human capabilities and uphold individual autonomy, dignity, and well-being.
- Users must have the ability to challenge or appeal decisions made or informed by AI.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Ethics Risk Assessment
- All new AI projects must undergo an ethical impact assessment prior to design and development.
- Projects with high societal or regulatory impact must be escalated to the AI Ethics Review Board.

### 4.2 Data Ethics and Collection
- Data used for training and inference must be ethically sourced and representative of the populations it affects.
- Regular reviews of data quality, representativeness, and potential bias are mandatory.

### 4.3 Model Auditing and Bias Testing
- Bias testing must be conducted at pre-deployment and post-deployment stages.
- Periodic independent audits should be performed for high-risk AI systems.

### 4.4 Stakeholder Engagement
- Whenever feasible, seek input from affected stakeholders, especially underrepresented groups, during the development and evaluation process.

### 4.5 Ethics Training
- All employees working with AI systems must complete annual training on ethical AI principles, discrimination risks, and responsible innovation.

## 5. Oversight and Governance

### 5.1 AI Ethics Review Board
- A cross-functional body responsible for:
  - Reviewing and approving high-risk AI initiatives
  - Advising on ethical dilemmas
  - Updating ethical guidelines in response to social and regulatory shifts

### 5.2 Reporting and Redress
- Provide clear channels for employees, customers, or users to report AI-related concerns or ethical violations.
- Establish protocols for investigating and resolving ethical issues and unintended consequences.

## 6. Compliance and Enforcement
- Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including revocation of project approval, retraining, or termination of contract or employment.
- The Compliance Office and Internal Audit Team will perform regular compliance checks.

## 7. Review Cycle
This policy shall be reviewed at least annually and updated based on technological, legal, or ethical developments.
