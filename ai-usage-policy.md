# AI Usage and Integration Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines the guidelines for the responsible and effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across business operations, ensuring AI systems are used lawfully, ethically, and in alignment with organizational goals and values.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, departments, and external partners using, integrating, or procuring AI toolsâ€”whether developed internally or acquired from third parties.

## 3. Definitions
- **AI System**: Any software or algorithm performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, including machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
- **Generative AI**: AI that produces content such as text, images, code, or audio.
- **High-Risk AI**: AI applications that impact decisions in hiring, lending, legal, healthcare, public safety, or other sensitive domains.

## 4. Acceptable Use Guidelines

### 4.1 Permitted Uses
- Automation of internal workflows (e.g., document classification, customer service routing)
- Content creation with human review (e.g., marketing drafts, reports)
- Forecasting and analytics for business intelligence
- Accessibility enhancements (e.g., voice recognition, transcription)

### 4.2 Restricted or Prohibited Uses
- Use of AI to make final decisions in employment, legal, or medical contexts without human review
- Submission of confidential or sensitive business data into unapproved third-party AI tools
- Use of AI tools for surveillance, profiling, or manipulation without legal and ethical justification
- Use of AI-generated content in public-facing material without clear disclosure and editorial review

## 5. AI Tool Approval and Integration

### 5.1 Procurement and Vendor Review
- All external AI tools must be reviewed and approved by the IT, Legal, and Data Governance teams.
- Vendors must demonstrate adherence to applicable standards for data protection, fairness, and explainability.

### 5.2 Internal Integration
- Business units must complete a use case assessment before deploying AI tools.
- Integration must follow secure coding practices and be documented for maintainability and audit purposes.

### 5.3 Pilot and Rollout
- New AI tools should begin with a pilot phase, followed by evaluation of effectiveness, ethical risk, and business value before full-scale deployment.

## 6. Data Handling and Input Restrictions
- Do not input personally identifiable information (PII), proprietary code, trade secrets, or financial data into generative AI tools unless explicitly approved.
- For tools using customer or employee data, anonymization or pseudonymization techniques must be employed.

## 7. Disclosure and Transparency
- When AI is used in external interactions (e.g., chatbots, content generation), customers must be clearly informed.
- Disclose if decisions or recommendations are AI-assisted and provide avenues for human escalation.

## 8. Oversight and Monitoring
- AI usage must be periodically reviewed by the AI Governance Committee for compliance and alignment with ethical guidelines.
- Logs of AI interactions and outputs must be maintained where feasible for auditing and traceability.

## 9. Training and Awareness
- All employees using AI tools must complete annual training on AI risks, best practices, and data privacy.
- Developers and product managers must complete role-specific training on responsible AI integration.

## 10. Compliance and Reporting
- Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including suspension of access or employment termination.
- Employees must report suspected misuse of AI tools or data immediately to their manager or the Compliance Office.

## 11. Review Cycle
This policy will be reviewed annually and revised based on updates in law, technology, and organizational priorities.
